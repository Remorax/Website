- I was a Teaching Assistant (TA) as part of the [Broadridge Executive Summer Training Program](http://blogs.iiit.ac.in/monthly_news/broadridge-executive-technology-program-on-software-engineering/) at IIIT, Hyderabad.
- My work as TA involved taking tutorials and lab sessions for ~50 [Broadridge](https://www.broadridge.com/intl/) executives on a variety of topics including Object Oriented Programming, Databases, Software Quality Engineering and Cryptography
- The tutorials consisted of teaching theory topics and resolving doubts, while the lab sessions involved setting tasks for the students to code and guiding them towards the solution.
