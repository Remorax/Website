- I worked for the open source organization [XWiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) as part of [**Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2018.
- Added language support for [Velocity Template Language](https://velocity.apache.org/engine/1.7/vtl-reference.html) in [Google Blockly](https://github.com/Remorax/blockly)
- Created a new Blockly toolbox to generate Velocity code for common XWiki scripting actions
- Packaged and shipped the Blockly toolbox as an [extension](https://extensions.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Extension/Blockly%20Editor/) for the XWiki application.
- Worked in a remote organization, had regular weekly meetings, interfaced with team members, followed coding best practices and documented all my work for the entire 3 month period
