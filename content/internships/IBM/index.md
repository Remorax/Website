- Currently working on developing a Deep-Learning based solution to solve the problem of Ontology Alignment in an effort to beat AML, the state-of-the-art that uses rule-based techniques.

- The focus is on detection of simple equivalence relationships, therefore we are currently working on incorporating graph attention-based algorithms to detect equivalence by representing a node both as a function of its own name and its neighbourhood.

- Doing so enables us to exploit both the syntactic and semantic structure of ontologies
