An ontology visualization & validation tool that allows an ontologist to pass accept/reject decisions on concepts newly extracted by an ontology enrichment system. Validation is crowdsourced, so quality control mechanisms are incorporated by evaluating user credibility using their Twitter profile. **Ongoing for [SRC 2020](https://src.acm.org/)**
