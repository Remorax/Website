Hello! I'm Vivek, an **IRE** researcher at [IIIT Hyderabad](https://www.iiit.ac.in/), where I am currently pursuing B.Tech + MS by Research in Computer Science.

My research work revolves around **ontologies** and **knowledge graphs** and I'm currently working on a variety of projects in this domain, the most notable of which involves using a combination of NLP and Deep Learning algorithms to automatically enrich ontologies from text.

Before starting out as a researcher, I used to work as an open source developer. My work in open source eventually led to me interning as a Software Developer for [XWiki](https://www.xwiki.org/xwiki/bin/view/Main/WebHome) at [**Google Summer of Code**](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/) 2018.

Broadly, here are a few research areas I am interested in:
